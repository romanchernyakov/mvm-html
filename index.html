  <p>3D Wizard-Machines, CGI masters, overlords of the 3D world, whatever you want to call them, <b>ManVsMachine</b> (MvM hereafter) are easily the leading Motion Graphic Design Studio in the world, in my opinion. With a studio in London and in Los Angeles, they truly are masters of their craft.</p>
  <p>With their clientele ranging from Apple to Microsoft and collaborating frequently with Nike, it’s easy to see why many of the big named brands want to work with the studio. Their quality is very evident, everything is precise, articulate and realised through skill-fully made 3D motion graphic design outcomes.

  <p>Formed in 2007 by Mike Alderson and Tim Swift, the agency has been pushing boundaries ever since it’s inception. They constantly challenge the conceptual approach to design along with the visual approach, often and flawlessly creating truly stunning pieces of motion design work. You know a MvM design piece when you see it, you can just about guess and know it’s them who made a particular advertisement, etc.

 <p>The studio specialises in Motion Graphic Design, Film and Visual Effects. They absolutely excel within their field and truly are a spectacle to behold especially when viewing their work. More times than not, I try and figure out their processes but I find myself lost and wanting to question my own ability in design and give it all up together, but they are seriously THAT good.
